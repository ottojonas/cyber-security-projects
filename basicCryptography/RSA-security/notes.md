RSA is a public-key encryption algorithm and the standard for encrypting data sent over the internet. It is also one of the methods used in PGP and GPG programs. Unlike Triple DES, RSA is considered an asymmetric algorithm because it uses a pair of keys. You have your public key to encrypt the message and a private key to decrypt it. RSA encryption results in a huge batch of mumbo jumbo that takes attackers a lot of time and processing power to break.
