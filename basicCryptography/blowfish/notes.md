Blowfish is known for its tremendous speed and overall effectiveness. Meanwhile, vendors have taken full advantage of its free availability in the public domain. You'll find Blowfish in software categories ranging from ecommerce platforms for securing payments to password management tools, where it protects passwords. It's one of the more flexible encryption methods available.
