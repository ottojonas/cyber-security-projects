Triple DES was designed to replace the original Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, which hackers eventually learned to defeat with relative ease. At one time, Triple DES was the industry's recommended standard and the most widely used symmetric algorithm.

Triple DES uses three individual keys with 56 bits each. The total key length adds up to 168 bits, but experts argue that 112 bits in key strength is more accurate. Despite slowly being phased out, Triple DES has mostly been replaced by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
